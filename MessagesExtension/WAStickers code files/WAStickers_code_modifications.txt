Changes to WAStickers code for compatibility

Add @objc attribute to init, addSticker, sendToWhatsApp methods in StickerPack.swift so that these methods can be called from Objective C.

Add #import "MessagesExtension-Swift.h" to MessagesViewController.m to access exposed @objc Swift methods. Command-Alt click on the filename in import statement to jump to definition and see the adapted Swift methods.

Need to rebuild app to generate the *-Swift.h file.

Commented out UIApplication open URL methods in Interoperability.swift because they do not compile in a MessagesExtension.

Remove pasteboard expiration date from Interoperatbility.swift.

Modify Interoperability.swift send method to return dataToSend.
Add passing WASticker pack Data (dataToSend) to sendToWhatsApp method completionHandler so that we can add it to the pasteboard ourselves if needed.
ex: @objc func sendToWhatsApp(completionHandler: @escaping (Bool, Data?) -> Void)

Set sticker pack JSON website keys in StickerPack.swift sendToWhatsApp method.

Set iOS App Store link code in Interoperability.swift send method.
ex: http://itunes.apple.com/app/id1171532447.

In sendToWhatsApp completionHandler method, set a SINGLE item in the UIPasteboard GeneralPasteboard with WAStickerCUSTOMUTI:DATATOSEND, public.url:whatsapp://stickerPack. The single item is contained in a dictionary with format of datatype:value.
