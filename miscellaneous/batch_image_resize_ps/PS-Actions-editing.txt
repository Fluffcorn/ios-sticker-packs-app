Photoshop actions only save the values that you actually change when recording and not any untouched values so getting the desired action values is difficult to save. 
To edit Photoshop actions:
1. Save actions from Photoshop by using actions palette
2. Run ActionFileToXML.jsx in Photoshop and use the saved .atn file.
3. Edit the xml with the desired values.
4. Run ActionFileFromXML.jsx in Photoshop and use the saved .xml file. It might crash photoshop but it will output a .atn file.
5. Load the .atn file as actions in Photoshop.
